  **Birds Are Not Real.** Or at least around 27% of birds. Have you ever seen a bird watching you a little bit *too* closely? Only to have it fly away when you start to question its motives... This is no coincedence. I am not here claiming all birds are fake or anything ridiculous like that, birds have been around for millions of years and are a key species in many environments. But not every bird you see is all it seems. I have done extensive research and much more extensive bird watching for the past 30 years of my life, and have determined that a certain portion of the birds you see in the sky are nothing more than machines.

They are placed in key locations throughout the world by governments in many different countries to monitor every human. Of course they travel with flocks of living birds to blend in. If you observe a flock of pigeons in a city you can almost always notice at least one bird that is different than the rest. Swiveling his head more than others, focusing on persons of interest, pretending to eat food, and many other suspicious activites. I have become very adept at discerning the government birds from the living ones, and I almost always have a bird following me. However, I managed to lose the birds momentatrily, so I'm rushing to get this written before they find me. I don't know how much longer I have so I'm gonna wrap this up and put the link to my research papers here. Thank you if you read this and do what you can to spread the truth.
